## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure that you have [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 

1. Copy the file called `.env.local.example` in the root of the project to `.env.local`, and change the value to point
   to your instance of [`racetime.dev`](https://github.com/racetimeGG/racetime-app).
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and have a look around.
